My journey in web development began at the Code Institute where I gained a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and  Django. After my Diploma I started to gain a deeper curiosity for JavaScript Frameworks and Librarys which lead me to Angular and React. I have 25 years’ experience as a Gas engineer and 4 years’ experience teaching English in Japan. I consider myself to be a good team-player with strong communication skills.
